## Hi there 👋
We're the **DnDGMod Development Team**; as you may have guessed, we're the people behind DnDGMod! We love D&DG and we love modding, so it just made sense to start modding D&DG. To find out how you can start using DnDGMod for absolutely free, visit our quickstart documentation at https://dndgmod.github.io

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
